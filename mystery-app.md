# Mystery App
The Mystery App is a simple API that has been implemented in many different programming languages and frameworks. The code within each has been copied as faithfully as possible. Every App has been containerized for ease of use and consistency. 

## Myster App Deliverables
- GitHub link to repository
  - src code
  - dockerfile to containerize
  - readme with description of app runtime
    - Optionally in poem form


## For implementing a version of Mystery App
- Do not worry about error handling
  - errors are part of the fun of deciphering what language/framework it is written in
- The code does not have to be scalable
  - A single file can be sufficient
